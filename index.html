            <p>Hi! My name is Emily. I'm a current student at UCLA Extension, and am learning how to
                code. I live in Los Angeles, California. I am originally from Ann Arbor, Michigan (where my immediate
                family still lives.)
                After high school, I went to Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo to study fashion design.<br>
                <br>During my Junior year, I studied in London through a study abroad program. During that time, my mom
                had a health scare, so I decided to transfer to
                the University of Michigan, where I graduated in 2006 with my BA. In the fall, I moved to NYC for an
                internship in fashion design.<br><br>
                After the internship I found a job in research, which was a support role for a fashion recruiter. I
                researched brands and their employees.
                Eventually I moved into recruiting in fashion and later, into tech recruiting. My husband works in
                animation and I was attracted to the LA weather, so we moved to sunny California.
                Through tech recruiting, I learned that web development seemed really fun, collaborative, and I was
                attracted to constant learning and problem-solving.
                Please enjoy my portfolio, and get in touch
                if you'd like!
